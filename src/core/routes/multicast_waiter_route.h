/* Resident multicast waiter lifecycle (CPP13).
 *
 * The route owns the resident socket and the two worker pthreads; every field
 * starts zeroed by init() and the status starts as ROUTE_RETRYABLE. The
 * validated order is fixed:
 *   disarm  -> stop_requested, drop consumer_go, wait for consumer_inflight,
 *              then mark kernel_disarmed;
 *   destroy -> join waiter, join owner, close the socket, mark userspace_clean
 *              and downgrade a non-OK armed route to ROUTE_FALLBACK_SAFE.
 * The one-shot route keeps its own small stack frame in
 * do_kernel5_fake_lock_route() and shares only the pure payload encoding.
 * The process-level resident lives in multicast_waiter_route.cpp and is
 * reached through resident_route(); the kernel5_resident_* wrappers in
 * route_operations.cpp forward to this class. */
