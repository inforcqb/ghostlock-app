# Third-party notices — `app/src/main/jni`

Scope: everything the `libmagica2.so` JNI library compiles. Origins and licences
as they stand in the tree *today*; the open item is spelled out at the bottom.

| Path | Origin | Licence header in the file |
|---|---|---|
| `magica.cpp` | ported from the Magica fork (`.scratch/magica-upstream`, branch `v21-adbroot-fix`; upstream Magica v2.1) | none — Magica upstream is **Unlicense** (public domain) |
| `logging.h` | Magica upstream, `TAG` retargeted | none — Unlicense |
| `android_filesystem_config.h` | AOSP (`system/core/include/private/android_filesystem_config.h`) | **Apache-2.0**, kept intact |
| `system_properties/**` | vendored AOSP `libcutils`/`libbase` properties fork (this is the bundled resetprop: `__system_property_find/update/add/delete/set`) | **BSD-3-Clause / Apache-2.0**, kept intact (every `.cpp`/`.h` carries its own AOSP header) |
| `lsplt/syscall.hpp` | Google / AOSP `syscall` wrapper | **BSD-3-Clause**, kept intact |
| `lsplt/**` (rest: `lsplt.cc`, `elf_util.cc/.hpp`, `logging.hpp`, `include/lsplt.hpp`) | **LSPlt**, an LSPosed project, vendored via Magica | **no licence header at all** |
| `Android.mk`, `Application.mk` | Magica/bionic-convention build files, adapted | n/a (build description, not shipped in the APK) |

The vendored files carry the licence headers they arrived with; **do not strip
those headers** when touching the files (in particular everything under
`system_properties/**` and `android_filesystem_config.h`).

Keep-this-in-mind facts about the vendored copies:

* `system_properties/**` is a *fork* of AOSP (it patches around the platform's
  restrictions, see `include/api/hacks.h`), so it is not a verbatim AOSP copy even
  though the headers are AOSP's.
* `lsplt/**` is used for exactly one hook: `capset` in
  `/system/lib64/libandroid_runtime.so` (see `JNI_OnLoad` in `magica.cpp`). If the
  licensing is not settled, that hook is the only thing that has to be rewritten —
  a self-written PLT/GOT patcher for one symbol is a small, contained piece of work
  (read the ELF, find the `.rela.plt` entry for `capset`, mprotect the page
  writable, store the replacement address, flush the instruction cache).

## TODO(licence) — must be settled before redistribution

**LSPlt (`app/src/main/jni/lsplt/**`, excluding `syscall.hpp`) is vendored with no
licence header and no settled licence for this tree.** Upstream LSPlt is an LSPosed
project; its licence terms have to be confirmed and recorded here (and a notice
added to `lsplt/**` and to the APK's own notices) **or** the library has to be
replaced by a self-written PLT/GOT patcher as described above. Until then this code
is prototype-grade and must not be redistributed in a release build.
